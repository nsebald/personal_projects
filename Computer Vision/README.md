# Computer Vision Final Project

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for my Computer Vision final project: **Timeshock**.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates advanced computer vision techniques using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It showcases my skills in image processing, analysis, and the application of machine learning methods to solve real-world problems.

## File Structure
- `Final Project_Timeshock.ipynb` â€” Main Jupyter notebook containing all code, explanations, and results.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the notebook `Final Project_Timeshock.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow the instructions and code cells in the notebook to explore the project.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Common Python libraries for computer vision (e.g., OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.)

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
